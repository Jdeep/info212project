    "#### Intro <br>\n",
    "The dataset we chose is about the  Russian Tweets During the 2016 election. About 200,000 tweet by about 3,000 users were collected by NBC, to analyzed and try to develop characteristics about Russian Tweets. The data collected was broken into two csv’s, the first users.csv contains the 3,000 users associated with Tweets and tweets.csv which contains the 200,000 tweets. As for the data itself it has a great deal of missing and incomplete data. Each row in tweets.csv has missing or incomplete data in it. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objectives<br>\n",
    "The objective of this project is to analyze the tweets and users, to see if there’s any shared common characteristics among the users and  Russian Tweets. So, in future election we can use this data to predict and mitigate future social media attacks. This data can also be used to see if any outside influences or large corporation are trying to sway the general public’s view on certain topics related or unrelated to politics. \n",
    "Using libraries such as word cloud, plotly, and pandas we will be visualizing data relating to the most used words in tweets, most popular hashtags,  and when the tweets were tweeted. In relation to the user we will be looking at where the user is from, when the account were created, their friend count and so on. We will create word clouds based on location/date account created and the most common used words. Looking at the most popular topics people are tweeting along with the date. A few examples of how we will clean the dataset are removing all  emojis /other special characters and moving them to another  column for analysis, and by replacing all the empty data in retweets_count and replacing it with 0’s and replacing all categorical data with a numerical scale.\n",
    "<br> <br>\n",
    "During the analysis of the Twitter dataset, we hope to have a better understanding of what Russian “Troll Tweet” is and how to identify it. Also, we hope to analyze and understand if the dataset we chose truly focused solely on Russian Tweets and user accounts. \n"

We would like to see if the tweets share any characteristics, so that in the future it will be easier to identify these tweets and filter them out. \n",
